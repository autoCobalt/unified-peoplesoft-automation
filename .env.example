# Local Environment Configuration
# ===========================================
# This file is git-ignored and safe for local secrets
# For reference, see .env.example for all available options
# ===========================================

# Vite exposes env vars prefixed with VITE_ to the client
# See: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html

# ===========================================
# APPLICATION MODE
# ===========================================
# Controls whether the app uses mock data or real connections
# Options: development | production
#   - development: Uses placeholder functions and localhost mock servers
#                  Safe for testing and demonstrations
#   - production:  Connects to real PeopleSoft/Oracle systems
#                  USE WITH CAUTION - actions affect live data
VITE_APP_MODE=development
#VITE_APP_MODE=production

# ===========================================
# DEVELOPMENT MODE SETTINGS
# ===========================================
# Mock server endpoint (used when VITE_APP_MODE=development)
# This should point to your local mock server for testing
VITE_DEV_MOCK_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Simulated network delay in milliseconds
# Helps test loading states and async behavior realistically
# Set to 0 for instant responses during rapid development
VITE_DEV_MOCK_DELAY_MS=500

# ===========================================
# ORACLE SQL CONNECTION
# ===========================================
# Uses node-oracledb Thin Mode - NO Oracle Client installation needed!
# Requires Oracle Database 12.1 or later
#
# Users will provide their own username/password through the frontend.
# These settings define WHERE to connect, not WHO connects.
# -------------------------------------------

# [REQUIRED] Oracle database server hostname or IP
VITE_ORACLE_HOSTNAME=your-oracle-server.company.com

# [OPTIONAL] Oracle listener port (default: 1521)
VITE_ORACLE_PORT=1521

# [REQUIRED] Oracle service name (ask your DBA if unsure)
VITE_ORACLE_SERVICE_NAME=HRDEV

# ===========================================
# PEOPLESOFT SOAP CONNECTION
# ===========================================
# Connection settings for PeopleSoft Component Interface SOAP requests.
#
# Users will provide their own PeopleSoft credentials through the frontend.
# These settings define the PeopleSoft environment to connect to.
# -------------------------------------------

# [OPTIONAL] Protocol - use 'https' for production (default: https)
VITE_PS_PROTOCOL=https

# [REQUIRED] PeopleSoft web server hostname
VITE_PS_SERVER=your-peoplesoft-server.company.com

# [OPTIONAL] PeopleSoft web server port (default: 443 for https)
VITE_PS_PORT=8443

# [REQUIRED] PeopleSoft site name (e.g., HRPRD, HRTST, FSPRD)
VITE_PS_SITE_NAME=YOURSITE

# [REQUIRED] Portal name (e.g., EMPLOYEE, CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER)
VITE_PS_PORTAL=EMPLOYEE

# [REQUIRED] Default local node name (usually PT_LOCAL)
VITE_PS_NODE=PT_LOCAL

# ===========================================
# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================
# Production CORS allowed origins (comma-separated, no spaces)
#
# IMPORTANT: In development mode (VITE_APP_MODE=development), localhost is
# automatically allowed. But in production mode, you MUST explicitly list
# all allowed origins - including localhost if testing locally!
#
# For local production testing (npm run dev with VITE_APP_MODE=production):
VITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
#
# For actual production deployment:
# VITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.company.com,https://staging.company.com
#
# If not set in production mode, only same-origin requests are allowed
# (which will block the frontend from calling the API!)

# ===========================================
# FEATURE FLAGS
# ===========================================
# Enable verbose console logging for debugging
# Set to false in production to reduce console noise
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=true

# Enable audit trail logging for all data modifications
# Recommended: true for production environments
# VITE_ENABLE_AUDIT_TRAIL=true

# ===========================================
# SQL DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================
# Configure paths for the three-tier SQL file system.
# Server SQL files are bundled with the app (read-only).
# Shared and personal directories are optional.

# [OPTIONAL] Shared-Users SQL directory (network path or local directory)
# This is a department-level directory accessible to multiple users.
# Examples:
#   Windows network share: //fileserver/department/sql
#   Mapped drive: S:/shared/sql
#   Linux/Mac mount: /mnt/shared/sql
VITE_SQL_SHARED_PATH=

# [OPTIONAL] Personal-User SQL directory default suggestion
# When users first configure their personal directory, this value
# is suggested as the default path. Actual path is stored in localStorage.
VITE_SQL_PERSONAL_DEFAULT=
