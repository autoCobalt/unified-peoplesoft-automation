Each CI-related field (POSITION_CREATE_CI, POSITION_UPDATE_CI, JOB_UPDATE_CI, DEPT_CO_UPDATE_CI) should be stored as its own context object for the smartform tab's context. The CI-related field itself will be a delimited string where the first two delimited values are [Action to use when submitting to PeopleSoft SOAP, Component Interface Name to use when submitting to PeopleSoft SOAP] with the following pattern (delimiter will be a pipe "|", with ":" used to further delimit "Field # Property" key from "Field # value" value. Please note that the field ordering may not be the same as the component interface's ordering of field properties.):

"(Action to use when submitting to PeopleSoft SOAP)|(Component Interface Name to use when submitting to PeopleSoft SOAP)|(Field 1 property name):(Field 1 value)|(Field 2 property name):(Field 2 value)|(etc.)"

Examples of data that may be found in these CI-related fields (These examples will not contain all expected fields, but it will show how they will look with data returned. Fields that are missing but expected are to be stored as null values):
- "CREATE|CI_POSITION_DATA|POSITION_NBR:00000000|EFFDT:25-FEB-26|EFF_STATUS:A|ACTION_REASON:NEW|BUSINESS_UNIT:WMH|DEPTID:2213|JOBCODE:220099|MAX_HEAD_COUNT:99"
- "UPDATE|CI_POSITION_DATA|POSITION_NBR:12312345|EFFDT:22-JAN-26|EFF_STATUS:A|ACTION_REASON:UPD|BUSINESS_UNIT:WFM|DEPTID:3113"
- "UPDATEDATA|CI_JOB_DATA|KEYPROP_EMPLID:555288|KEYPROP_EMPL_RCD:1|KEYPROP_EFFDT:12-JAN-26|KEYPROP_EFFSEQ:1|BUSINESS_UNIT:CFG|DEPTID:8235|MAX_HEAD_COUNT:99"
